Take a look at the data and see for yourself. Consider: what would be the benefits and drawbacks to this method of sparsity reduction? Note that, for this part of the assignment, the tags are un-necessary, so you'll want to work with the un-normalized version of the corpus.\n",

    "### Maximum Likelihood\n",
    "Now, start by producing code to compute maximum-likelihood estimate probabilities. Your code should be configurable with respect to the n-gram order- i.e., you should be able to set it to compute bigram, trigram, 4-gram, etc. probabilities. Refer to J&M and the lecture slides for definitions as needed. If you would like to write your own n-gram tokenization code, feel free to do so, but you may also use the ngrams.py utility class which contains a routine to take a list of tokens and produce a stream of n-grams with appropriate padding for the start and end of sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tip: \n",
    "* Start with a very small \"toy\" corpus of just a couple of sentences for debugging. \n",
    "\n",
    "* As discussed in class, I strongly recommend using nested defaultdicts as the foundational data structure for your language model, where the \"outer\" key is the prefix, and the value retrieved by that prefix is a second defaultdict  containing possible suffices for that prefix, each of which is an \"inner\" key. E.g., p(\"TRUTHS\" | \"HOLD THESE\") would be retrieved by first looking up \"HOLD THESE\" and then from the resulting dictionary, looking up \"TRUTHS\": prob = trigrams[(\"HOLD\",\"THESE\")][\"TRUTHS\"] . Note that this arrangement makes it very easy to e.g. find out the number of times a given history occurs, the total probability mass assigned to all of a history's continuations, etc., all of which will be extremely helpful in the next part of the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use tuples to represent prefixes. E.g., instead of the string \"HOLD THESE\", use the tuple (\"HOLD\", \"THESE\"). Note that, in Python, lists are mutable, and therefore may not be used as keys in dictionaries- but tuples are immutable, and so make excellent keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't forget about numerical underflow issues! You'll want to represent probabilities as negative base-2 log probabilities, and modify your arithmetic accordingly. I recommend experimenting with [the bitweight Python library](https://github.com/stevenbedrick/bitweight) (see its unit tests for example usage).\n",
    "* \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What to turn in:\n",
    "* your code \n",
    "* use your code to create a simple language model for small_corpus named as small_lm and show me that your output is correct(This is a small coupus so you could manully calculate the probalility).\n",
    "* use your code to create language model for wsj.pos.gz named as wsj_lm"
