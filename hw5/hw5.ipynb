    "This homework we'll be focusing on Viterbi Algorithm given an existing HMM. The goal of the homework is to find the likelihood of an utterance and the best   state sequence.\n",

    "ech sample, 10 msec apart. (See the `input\\*.txt` files.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parameters (mean and variance vectors) of two “yes” and “no” GMMs are given . (See the `(mean|var)_\\*.txt` files.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transition probabilities of  “yes” and “no” HMMs are given. Each row is the transition probability for one state. For example, row 1 colum 3 is the transition probability from state 1 to state 3 (See the `trans_\\*.txt` files.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assume equal initial probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assume that this is a whole-word recognizer, and that each word is recognized with a separate execution of the program. This will greatly simplify the implementation.\n",

    "* The mixture weights <font color=red>are NOT</font> in the log domain.\n",
